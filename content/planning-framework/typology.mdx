# Overview
The STRUDEL Typology is a conceptual tool for categorizing elements of scientific projects building and using software products. The typology helps identify and compare common activities in scientific work that should be considered when focusing on requirements, user experience, software sustainability, and so on for software. The focus on software production and use, especially its UX and sustainability, is a key distinction and bias of the STRUDEL Typology

# Motivation
STRUDEL 
A typology enables a user to systematically analyze & compare diverse scientific projects. This analysis helps surface commonalities that impact user experiences & sustainability of the software being produced and used.
