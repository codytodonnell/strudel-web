Have you found building and delivering usable scientific software to be challenging? Encountering challenges meeting user needs with the software you’re developing?

The Berkeley Lab Scientific Data Division User Experience (UX) team has launched the Scientific sofTware Research for User experience, Design, Engagement, and Learning (STRUDEL) project to address these pain points. STRUDEL is an open source science project building resources to enable teams to plan, design, and build user-centered software for their scientific communities. STRUDEL is developing two key products. First, a Planning Framework to make it easier to identify and consider UX and sustainability concerns when planning new applications or features. Second, an extensible Design System for implementing usable web interfaces.

Please join us for the STRUDEL project’s upcoming series of events to help support you adopt user experience (UX) approaches in scientific software development. See below or visit [https://strudel.science](https://strudel.science) to learn more!
