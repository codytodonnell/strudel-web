  STRUDEL Design System provides a set of reusable components and patterns along with guidelines for designing and implementing user interfaces in science and research domains. It is framed and guided by ‘Task flows’, which are step wise flows through a user interface to accomplish particular tasks.

  ## STRUDEL products
  STRUDEL task flows consists of a visual documentation and coded library:
  
  ### Design template
  Task Flows are visualized through step-by-step mockups (UI screens) documenting the process of completing a task and illustrating a user's journey through a UI. They also have corresponding design & usage guidelines.

  ### Code library
  The task-flows have their coded templates in the UI code library. This library uses the React JavaScript framework and is based on the popular Material UI (MUI) Components library.
