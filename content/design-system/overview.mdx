  STRUDEL Design System provides a set of reusable components and patterns along with guidelines for designing and implementing user interfaces for scientific software. This design system is distinct since it is organized around 'Task Flows', which are the step wise flows a user takes to accomplish specified tasks.

  ## STRUDEL products
  STRUDEL Task Flows consists of a visual design template and a code library.
  
  ### Design template
  Task Flows are visualized through step-by-step mockups (UI screens) documenting the process of completing a task and illustrating a user's journey through a GUI. They also have corresponding design & usage guidelines.

  ### Code library
  Task Flows have their code templates implemented in the STRUDEL UI Code Library ('strudel-kit'). The Strudel UI Code Library uses the React JavaScript framework and is based on the popular Material UI (MUI) Components library.
