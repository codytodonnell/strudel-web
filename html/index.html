    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The Scientific sofTware Research for User experience, Design, Engagement, and
        Learning project (STRUDEL) will create, using <em>user research</em>
        methodologies, a <em>typology</em> and <em>design system</em> for scientific
        software that will guide and support the development of highly functional and
        usable user interfaces.</p>
    <ul class="hanging-indent">
        <li><b>User research</b>.
        We are performing <em>user research</em> that will study artifacts,
            including software, user interfaces, and published literature;
            we are also conducting interviews with select project team members.
            From this qualitative data, we will identify the <em>characteristics of
            scientific software ecosystems</em>.
        </li>
        <li><b>Typology</b>.
        We will use the characteristics of scientific ecosystems to inform a
            <em>typology</em>, which includes scientific users' <em>work patterns</em>,
            onto which we will map existing software and projects.
        </li>

        <li><b>Design system</b>.
        By mapping project characteristics to typology categories, we will identify
            common patterns and construct abstract workflows that will be represented as
            <em>user interface (UI) flows</em> -- how a user progresses through a UI. To
            bring these UI flows directly to teams creating new interfaces, we will
            develop a <em>design system</em> that includes workflows, layouts, and
            components.
